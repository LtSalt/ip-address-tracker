# IP Address Tracker

My take on [frontendmentor's IP Address Tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) challenge.

## Instructions
- one-page IP tracker
  - displays users's IP address on pageload
  - lets user search for arbitrary IP address or domain
- includes a searchbar, a map and an info box
- info box halfway between header and map
- responsive for desktop and mobile
- hover states for all interactive elements
- uses leaflet and the geoipify API

## TODO
- Responsivity for mobile devices
- remove highlight on input
- Hover states
